<p class="white">Blizzard EntertainmentÂ® (often shortened to "Blizzard" or "Blizz" by players) is a video game developer & publisher that is responsible for the Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, and Overwatch franchises. The company originally concentrated primarily on the creation of game ports for other studios before beginning development of their own program with the development of games like Rock n' Roll Racing & The Lost Vikings. In July 2008, Blizzard's parent company, Vivendi, merged their Vivendi Games subsidiary with Activision to create a new holding company called Activision Blizzard. Five years later, in July 2013, Vivendi sold off most of its shares in Activision Blizzard, which now exists as an independent company.

<h2 class="white">Assault on Blackwing Lair</h2>
<p class="white">Deep within Blackrock Mountain, the black dragon Nefarian conducted twisted experiments with the blood of other dragonflights. Intent on seizing the entire area for his own, he recruited the remaining Dark Horde, a rogue army that embraced the demonic bloodlust of the old Horde. These corrupt orcs, trolls, and other races battled against Ragnaros and the Dark Iron dwarves for control of the mountain. Nefarian created the twisted chromatic dragons and a legion of other aberrations in his bid to form an army powerful enough to control Azeroth and continue the legacy of his infamous father, Deathwing the Destroyer. Nefarian was vanquished by the heroes from the Horde and the Alliance.<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft>source</a></p>
